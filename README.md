## Power BI ETL and Dashboard Project

This repository showcases a structured ETL workflow and the development of interactive dashboards in Power BI to derive meaningful business insights from raw data.

**Workflow Breakdown:**

**🔹 Step 1: ETL Process**

* **Extract:** Uploaded the CSV file into Power BI.
* **Transform:**
    * Cleaned and formatted the data for consistency and accuracy.
    * Ensured correct data types were applied to all columns.
    * Enhanced the Date table to facilitate robust time-based analysis and reporting.
* **Load:** Successfully loaded the transformed data into the Power BI data model, ready for analysis and visualization.

**🔹 Step 2: Measures & Calculated Columns**

* Created key calculated measures and columns using DAX to derive important business insights.
* Defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to effectively track revenue, profitability, and sales trends.

**🔹 Step 3: Monthly Sales & Profit% Dashboard 📈**

* Developed an interactive dashboard to visualize monthly sales trends and profit percentages over time.
* Enabled dynamic filtering using slicers to analyze trends across different time periods (e.g., year, quarter, month).

**🔹 Step 4: Sales by Product Hierarchy 📦**

* Built a product category-wise analysis dashboard to track sales performance across different product categories and subcategories.
* Allowed users to drill down into specific product levels for granular performance evaluation.

**🔹 Step 5: Regional Sales Dashboard 🌍**

* Designed an interactive regional sales dashboard to analyze sales performance by different geographical regions.
* Integrated a map visualization to clearly display the distribution of sales across multiple locations.

**Key Features:**

* ✔ Interactive dashboards equipped with slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration.
* ✔ Comprehensive KPI calculations for sales revenue and profitability analysis.
* ✔ Detailed product hierarchy and category-based sales performance analysis.
* ✔ Clear geographical sales distribution visualized using interactive map visualizations.
* ✔ Monthly sales and profit trends to effectively track seasonality and growth patterns.

**Tools & Technologies Used:**

* **Power BI:** Primary tool for data visualization, dashboard creation, and interactive reporting.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used extensively for creating calculated measures and columns to derive business logic.
* **Power Query (M Language):** Utilized for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.

**Conclusion:**

This project demonstrates the significant value of Power BI in transforming raw data into actionable intelligence. The structured ETL process combined with effective data visualization techniques empowers data-driven decision-making and provides valuable insights into business performance.
